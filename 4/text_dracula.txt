At the first howl the horses began to strain and rear, 
but the driver spoke to them soothingly, 
and they quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from sudden fright. 
Then, far off in the distance, 
from the mountains on each side of us began a louder and a sharper howling, 
that of wolves, which affected both the horses and myself in the same way. 
For I was minded to jump from the caleche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged madly, 
so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them from bolting. 
In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to the sound, 
and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able to descend and to stand before them. 
When I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me. 
I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of every window I could find, 
but after a little the conviction of my helplessness overpowered all other feelings. 
When I look back after a few hours I think I must have been mad for the time, 
for I behaved much as a rat does in a trap. 
When, however, the conviction had come to me that I was helpless I sat down quietly, as quietly as I have ever done anything in my life, and began to think over what was best to be done. 
I am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. 
Of one thing only am I certain. 
That it is no use making my ideas known to the Count. 
He knows well that I am imprisoned, and as he has done it himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive me if I trusted him fully with the facts. 
So far as I can see, my only plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes open. 
I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears, or else I am in desperate straits, and if the latter be so, I need, and shall need, all my brains to get through.
